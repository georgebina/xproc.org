<para>XProc is designed to be extensible. The Working Group fully expects
implementors to develop new steps in response to user demand.</para>

<para>The <link xlink:href="http://exproc.org/">exproc.org</link>
website has been established as a place where these steps can be
cataloged and, where practical, made interoperable.</para>

<para>The best place to discuss extension steps that you'd like to see
standardized in an interoperable way is on the
“<literal>xproc-dev</literal>” mailing list.
