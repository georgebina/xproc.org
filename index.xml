<para>XProc.org is a website about
<citetitle>XProc: An XML Pipeline Language</citetitle>, a
specification under development at the <link

and extensions.</para>

<section xml:id="spec">
<title>What is it?</title>

<para>XProc is a language designed for describing operations to be performed
on XML documents. The official specification for XProc is
<citetitle xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xproc/">XProc:
An XML Pipeline Language</citetitle>. It is a
<link xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#rec-publication">Recommendation</link>.</para>

<para>The XProc specification was produced by the <link
xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Processing/">XML Processing Model Working
Group</link>. The XProc WG operated in the public, anyone is free to read <link
xlink:href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xml-processing-model-wg/">the
archives</link> of its mailing list.</para>

<para>While the WG was in operation, public comments on the specification could be sent to
the <link xlink:href="mailto:public-xml-processing-model-comments@w3.org">processing
model comments</link> mailing list.
<link xlink:href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xml-processing-model-comments/">The archives</link>
of the comments list are also open to the public. Now that the
WG has been disbanded, readers are encouraged to submit comments to the community
through the GitHub issue tracker.</para>

<section xml:id="usecases">
<title>Why did you do it?</title>

<para>XProc is designed to address the common problem of how to compose
XML processes. Many document processing scenarios involve some combination
of XML technologies; canonical examples include XInclude, schema validation,
and transformation.</para>

<para>Although it is possible to combine these technologies using general
purpose tools such as
<link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">make</link> and 
<link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Ant">ant</link> (to name
only two), these tools are not designed to deal specifically with the semantics
of XML processing. As such they are often both more complicated and less
useful than would be ideal</para>

<para>XProc has been designed specifically to allow authors to compose XML
processes and share these compositions in a standard way.</para>

<para>For more details about the requirements of XProc and the use cases
that it was designed to solve, see
<citetitle xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xproc-requirements/">XML
Processing Model Requirements and Use Cases</citetitle>.</para>

<title>How do I participate?</title>

<para>All users, implementors, and other developers with an interest
in XProc are encouraged to join the “<literal>xproc-dev</literal>” mailing
list. Send a “<literal>subscribe</literal>” request to
<email>xproc-dev-request@w3.org</email> to join.</para>

<para>It too is
<link xlink:href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xproc-dev/">archived</link>
for your pleasure. It is

<section xml:id="testsuite">
<title>What about examples?</title>

<para>An official test suite for XProc is under development. See
