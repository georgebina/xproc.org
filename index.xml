<para>XProc.org is a website about
<citetitle>XProc: An XML Pipeline Language</citetitle>, a
specification under development at the <link

<title>What is it?</title>

<para>XProc is a language designed for describing operations to be performed
on XML documents. The official specification for XProc is
<citetitle xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xproc/">XProc:
An XML Pipeline Language</citetitle>. It is a
<link xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#rec-publication">Recommendation</link>.</para>

<para>The XProc specification is produced by the
<link xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/XML/Processing/">XML Processing Model
Working Group</link>. The XProc WG operates in the public, anyone is free
to read
<link xlink:href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xml-processing-model-wg/">the archives</link> of its mailing list. Public comments on the specification
may be sent to the
<link xlink:href="mailto:public-xml-processing-model-comments@w3.org">processing
model comments</link> mailing list.
<link xlink:href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-xml-processing-model-comments/">The archives</link> of the comments list are also open to the
public.</para>

<title>Latest snapshots</title>

<para>The Working Group successfully transitioned from Last Call to
<link xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/2005/10/Process-20051014/tr.html#cfi">Candidate
Recommendation</link>. It is now working on resolving comments on the CR
draft and building a test suite.</para>

<para>The unofficial
<link xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/XML/XProc/docs/langspec.html">Editor's
Draft</link> provides the most up-to-date snapshot of the specification, though
it does not always represent the consensus view of the working group.</para>

<section xml:id="usecases">
<title>Why did you do it?</title>

<para>XProc is designed to address the common problem of how to compose
XML processes. Many document processing scenarios involve some combination
of XML technologies; canonical examples include XInclude, schema validation,
and transformation.</para>

<para>Although it is possible to combine these technologies using general
purpose tools such as
<link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Make_(software)">make</link> and 
<link xlink:href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Ant">ant</link> (to name
only two), these tools are not designed to deal specifically with the semantics
of XML processing. As such they are often both more complicated and less
useful than would be ideal</para>

<para>XProc has been designed specifically to allow authors to compose XML
processes and share these compositions in a standard way.</para>

<para>For more details about the requirements of XProc and the use cases
that it was designed to solve, see
<citetitle xlink:href="http://www.w3.org/TR/xproc-requirements/">XML
Processing Model Requirements and Use Cases</citetitle>.</para>

<section xml:id="xproc-dev">
<title>How do I participate?</title>

<para>All users, implementors, and other developers with an interest
in XProc are encouraged to join the “<literal>xproc-dev</literal>” mailing
list. Send a “<literal>subscribe</literal>” request to
<email>xproc-dev-request@w3.org</email> to join.</para>

<para>It too is
<link xlink:href="http://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/xproc-dev/">archived</link>
for your pleasure. It is
<link xlink:href="http://markmail.org/search/?q=list%3Axproc-dev">even
more usefully archived</link> on

<section xml:id="testsuite">
<title>What about examples?</title>

<para>An official test suite for XProc is under development. See
<link xlink:href="http://tests.xproc.org/"/> for more information.
